</H1>  


 
<h2>
    First, the basics.
</h2>

 
    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Javascript</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
     </ul>
    
    
    <p>You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Coloring Book</li> 
        <li> Marshall Mathers LP2</li>
        <li>Born Sinner</li>
        <li>To Pimp a Butterfly</li>
        <li>Offseason</li>
    </ol> 
    
    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>
    
   <h2>Empty Elements</h2> 
    
    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/> 
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

    <h2>Images </h2>
    
    <p>Include the four images from the links and images tutorial below</p>

    <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
    
  

    

   

    



    
    
    Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
    <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
